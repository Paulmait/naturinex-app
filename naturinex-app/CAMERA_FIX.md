# üì∏ Camera Feature Status

## Current Situation

‚úÖ **Working:**
- Manual medication name entry (type "Aspirin", "Tylenol", etc.)
- Real AI analysis from Gemini API
- Backend is fully functional

‚ùå **Not Working:**
- Camera image upload
- Barcode scanning

## Why Camera Isn't Working

The camera tries to upload images to the backend, but:
1. FormData image upload is complex in React Native
2. The backend `/api/analyze` endpoint is a placeholder
3. Image recognition requires additional services (Google Vision API, etc.)

## Quick Workaround

For now, use the **manual entry** feature:
1. Take a photo of the medication
2. Click "Enter Medication Name"
3. Type the medication name you see
4. Get real AI analysis

## Future Implementation

To make camera work properly, you would need:
1. **OCR Service** - Google Vision API or similar to read text from images
2. **Barcode Database** - To lookup medications by barcode
3. **Image Processing** - Server-side image handling

## Testing Your App

The app is fully functional with:
- ‚úÖ Real AI medication analysis
- ‚úÖ Natural alternatives suggestions
- ‚úÖ Drug interactions
- ‚úÖ Firebase authentication
- ‚úÖ All core features

Just use manual entry instead of camera for now!
