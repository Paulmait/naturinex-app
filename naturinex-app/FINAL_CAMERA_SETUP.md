# âœ… Final Camera Setup - You're Almost There!

## Your Google Vision API is ENABLED! 

Now just create an API key:

### Step 1: Create API Key (2 minutes)

1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services** â†’ **Credentials**
2. Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** â†’ **"API key"**
3. Copy the API key that appears
4. (Optional) Click "Restrict Key" and add restrictions:
   - Application restrictions: None (for testing)
   - API restrictions: Restrict to Cloud Vision API

### Step 2: Add to Render (1 minute)

1. Go to your Render service: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your `naturinex-app-zsga` service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add new environment variable:
   ```
   GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY = AIza... (your key here)
   ```
5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Render will automatically redeploy

### Step 3: Test It!

Once deployed (takes ~2 minutes), your camera will:
- Extract text from medication labels
- Identify medication names
- Provide real AI analysis
- Work perfectly for beta testers!

## What Happens Without the Key?

Even without the API key, your app works great:
- Camera still takes photos
- Returns mock medication data
- Shows "isMockData: true" flag
- Manual entry always available

## Cost for Beta Testing

- First 1,000 images/month: **FREE**
- After that: $1.50 per 1,000 images
- Perfect for beta testing!

## Quick Test

After adding the key, test by:
1. Open app in Expo Go
2. Go to camera screen
3. Take photo of any text (even non-medication)
4. You'll see real OCR results!

Your beta testers will love the camera feature! ðŸ“¸
