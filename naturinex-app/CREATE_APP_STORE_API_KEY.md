## Step 2: Navigate to API Keys
1. Click on "Users and Access" (top menu)

## Step 4: Download the Key
**IMPORTANT**: You can only download this key ONCE!

3. Note down:
   - **Issuer ID** (shown at the top of the page)

C:\Users\maito\mediscan-app\naturinex-app\secrets\AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
```

## Step 6: Update eas.json
Your eas.json already has placeholders. Update them with your values:

```json
"submit": {
  "production": {
    "ios": {
      "appleId": "crazya1c@hotmail.com",
      "ascAppId": "6749164831",
      "appleTeamId": "LFB9Z5Q3Y9",
      "ascApiKeyPath": "./secrets/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8",
      "ascApiKeyId": "XXXXXXXXXX",
      "ascApiKeyIssuerId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 7: Add to .gitignore
**NEVER commit your API key!**
Add to .gitignore:
```
secrets/
*.p8
```
