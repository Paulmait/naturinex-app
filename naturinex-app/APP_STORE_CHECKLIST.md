Replace these placeholder values in the `extra` section:
```json
"firebaseApiKey": "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY",
"firebaseAuthDomain": "YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN",
"firebaseProjectId": "YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID",
"firebaseStorageBucket": "YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET",
"firebaseMessagingSenderId": "YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
"firebaseAppId": "YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
```

**Also update:** `client/src/firebase.js` to use the same project (currently using mediscan-b6252)

## 2. Google OAuth Configuration

**Location:** `client/app.json` (lines 79-81)

Replace these placeholder values:
```json
"googleExpoClientId": "YOUR_GOOGLE_EXPO_CLIENT_ID",
"googleIosClientId": "YOUR_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID",
"googleAndroidClientId": "YOUR_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID"
```

## 3. Apple App Store Configuration

**Location:** `client/eas.json` (lines 42-44)

Replace these values for iOS submission:
```json

"appleTeamId": "your-apple-team-id"
```

## 4. Google Play Store Configuration

1. Create a service account in Google Play Console
2. Download the JSON key file
3. Save it as `client/google-play-key.json`

**Fix:** Update line 5 in `client/app.json`:
```json
"owner": "pmaitland78",
```

## 6. Version Numbers

Before each release, update:
- `client/app.json` line 6: `"version": "1.0.0"` (increment for each release)
- `client/app.json` line 37: `"buildNumber": "1"` (iOS - increment for each build)
- `client/app.json` line 54: `"versionCode": 1` (Android - increment for each build)
