# 🎯 Use Your Existing API Key!

You already have **"API key 4"** that should work!

## Quick Steps:

### 1. Get Your API Key
- Click on **"API key 4"** (created Jul 25, 2025)
- Click the **"SHOW KEY"** button or copy icon
- Copy the key (starts with `AIza...`)

### 2. Add to Render Now
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your `naturinex-app-zsga` service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add:
   ```
   GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY = [paste your API key 4 here]
   ```
5. Click **Save Changes**

### 3. That's It! 
- Render will redeploy automatically (2-3 minutes)
- Camera OCR will work immediately after deploy
- Your beta testers can scan real medications!

## Verify It's Working

After deployment, check your Render logs. You should see:
- "📊 Analyzing medication from image"
- "Detected text: [actual text from image]"

Instead of:
- "⚠️ Google Vision API not configured - using mock response"

## If API Key 4 Doesn't Work

Try the "mediscan-client" key instead - it has access to 24 APIs including Vision.

Your camera feature is ready to go! Just add that API key to Render. 🚀
