## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If API Key Doesn't Work:
1. **Check for spaces**: Make sure no extra spaces before/after the key
2. **Check quotes**: Don't include quotes around the key
3. **Verify key**: Test at https://makersuite.google.com/app/prompts

### If Render Won't Restart:
1. Click "**Manual Deploy**" button
2. Choose "**Deploy latest commit**"

### If Still Getting Errors:
Check Render logs for:
- "GEMINI_API_KEY is not defined"
- "Failed to initialize Gemini"
- Any other error messages

## ðŸ“± Remove Mock Data After Testing

Once the API key is working:

1. Go back to `src/screens/AnalysisScreen.js`
2. Remove the mock code:
   - Delete the `getMockAnalysis` function
   - Uncomment the original fetch code
   - Delete the mock implementation

Or I can do this for you once you confirm the API is working!
