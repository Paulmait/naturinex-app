   SELECT 
     pricing_group,
     COUNT(*) as views,
     SUM(converted) as conversions,
     AVG(amount) as avg_revenue
   FROM pricing_analytics
   GROUP BY pricing_group
   ```

2. **Promo Code Usage**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     promo_code,
     COUNT(*) as uses,
     SUM(discount_amount) as total_discount
   FROM subscriptions
   WHERE promo_code IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY promo_code
   ```

3. **Trial Conversion Rate**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) as trials_started,
     SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as converted,
     AVG(CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 as conversion_rate
   FROM subscriptions
   WHERE trial_end IS NOT NULL
   ```
