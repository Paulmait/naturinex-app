# ✅ Guest Mode & Layout Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Firebase Anonymous Auth Error ✅
**Problem**: Firebase anonymous authentication was not enabled, causing "admin-restricted-operation" error.

**Solution**: Implemented local guest mode without Firebase:
- Guest users get a local session ID
- No Firebase authentication required
- 3 free scans tracked locally
- Seamless upgrade to registered account

### 2. Linking Scheme Warning ✅
**Problem**: App was missing URL scheme configuration for deep linking.

**Solution**: Added `"scheme": "naturinex"` to app.json
- Prevents crashes in production
- Enables deep linking functionality
- URL format: `naturinex://...`

### 3. Screen Layout Adjustments ✅
**Improvements Made**:
- Added proper keyboard handling
- Improved scroll behavior
- Better button spacing
- Enhanced shadow effects
- Responsive padding
- Skip button more prominent with border

## How Guest Mode Works Now:

1. **Skip for Now**
   - Creates local guest session
   - No Firebase account needed
   - 3 free scans available
   - Shows remaining scans on home screen

2. **Scan Limits**
   - Yellow banner shows "X free scans remaining"
   - Decrements after each scan
   - Prompts to sign up when exhausted

3. **Easy Upgrade**
   - "Sign Up" button in yellow banner
   - Seamless transition to full account
   - All features unlocked after registration

## Testing the App:

1. **Guest Mode**:
   - Tap "Skip for Now (3 Free Scans)"
   - Should go directly to Home screen
   - Yellow banner shows remaining scans

2. **Sign Up**:
   - Toggle "Don't have an account? Sign Up"
   - Enter email and password
   - Creates new Firebase account

3. **Sign In**:
   - Use existing credentials
   - Or "Continue with Google"

## Note on Firebase Anonymous Auth:

If you want to enable Firebase anonymous auth later:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Authentication → Sign-in method
3. Enable "Anonymous"
4. Revert handleSkip to use signInAnonymously

Current implementation works without Firebase configuration!
