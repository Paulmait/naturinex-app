# AI & OCR Status Update - August 31, 2025

## Current Situation

### ✅ Progress Made
- **GEMINI_API_KEY** is now configured in Render environment variables
- Server is running and healthy (4+ days uptime)
- Frontend and backend code are ready for AI integration

### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **Gemini AI Errors**
   - The API key is set but the server is encountering "GoogleGenerativeAI Error" 
   - The `/suggest` endpoint returns 500 errors
   - This indicates the API key might be invalid or the server needs a restart

2. **Missing Google Vision API Key**
   - `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY` is NOT in your Render environment variables list
   - This means OCR/image scanning will not work
   - You need to add this key for image analysis features

3. **Endpoint Availability**
   - Most AI endpoints return 404 errors
   - The production server appears to be running a simplified version
   - Only `/suggest` and `/health` endpoints are available

## Required Actions

### 1. Restart the Render Service (Immediate)
The server needs to be restarted to properly load the GEMINI_API_KEY:
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d1s36m0dl3ps738vve30
2. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
3. Or click the restart button if available

### 2. Add Google Vision API Key
To enable OCR/image scanning:
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Enable Vision API
3. Create an API key
4. Add to Render environment variables:
   - Key: `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your Vision API key

### 3. Verify Gemini API Key
Make sure your GEMINI_API_KEY is valid:
1. Test it at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Ensure it has the correct permissions
3. Check if billing is enabled on your Google Cloud account

## Testing After Restart

Run this command to verify AI is working:
```bash
curl -X POST https://naturinex-app.onrender.com/suggest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"medicationName":"Aspirin","userId":"test"}'
```

Expected result if working:
- Status 200
- Real alternatives based on Gemini AI analysis
- Not the mock data (Turmeric, Omega-3, Magnesium)

## Current User Impact

Users are currently experiencing:
- ❌ No real AI analysis (getting errors)
- ❌ No OCR/image scanning capability
- ✅ App is functional with other features
- ⚠️ Mock data fallback may activate

## Summary

**The AI integration is 75% complete:**
- ✅ Code is ready
- ✅ GEMINI_API_KEY is added
- ⚠️ Server needs restart to load the key
- ❌ GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY is missing
- ⚠️ Gemini API errors need investigation

**Next Step:** Restart the Render service first, then test if AI starts working.
