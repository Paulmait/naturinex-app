## Current Blocking Issues (Must Fix Before Submission)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Expo SDK Version Outdated
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Current**: SDK 53.0.0
**Latest**: SDK 52+ required for App Store
**Action Required**: Update to SDK 52.0.0 (stable) or 51.0.0 (LTS)
```bash
# Run this command:
expo upgrade 52.0.0
```

### 2. üîê EAS Credentials Not Configured
**Risk Level**: BLOCKING
**Issues**:

**Action Required**:
1. Create Apple Developer account ($99/year)

### 3. üìÑ Legal Documents Not Hosted

### 4. üñºÔ∏è App Icon Verification Needed
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Check**: Run `verify-assets.ps1` script

### 5. üí≥ Stripe In-App Purchase Compliance

3. Submit to TestFlight: 1 hour
4. Apple review: 24-48 hours
5. Google review: 2-3 hours

**Total**: Could be live in 3-4 days

## Risk Assessment

**Without fixes**: 100% rejection (missing credentials)
**With fixes**: 10-15% rejection risk

**Potential rejection reasons**:
1. Stripe vs IAP (iOS only)
