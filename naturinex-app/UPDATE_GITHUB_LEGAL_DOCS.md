# ðŸ“„ Update GitHub Legal Documents

## What Happened:
1. Earlier, we updated the privacy policy and terms of service in your LOCAL project
2. These files are in: `src/components/PrivacyPolicyScreen.js` and `src/components/TermsOfUseScreen.js`
3. But your GitHub repository `naturinex-legal` has the OLD versions from 4 days ago

## Where Are The Updated Files:

### Local React Native Components:
- `C:\Users\maito\mediscan-app\naturinex-app\src\components\PrivacyPolicyScreen.js`
- `C:\Users\maito\mediscan-app\naturinex-app\src\components\TermsOfUseScreen.js`

### GitHub Repository (Old versions):
- https://github.com/Paulmait/naturinex-legal/

## How to Update GitHub:

### Option 1: Extract Content from React Components
1. Open `src/components/PrivacyPolicyScreen.js`
2. Copy all the text content (remove React/JavaScript code)
3. Create a proper HTML file
4. Upload to GitHub

### Option 2: Use the Enhanced Versions
The files in your GitHub repo are named:
- `privacy-policy-enhanced.html`
- `terms-of-service-enhanced.html`

These might already be the correct versions. Check if they contain:
- Medical disclaimers
- AI technology notices
- GDPR/CCPA compliance sections
- Emergency warnings

### Option 3: Let Me Create Updated HTML Files
I can create the updated HTML files from the React components if you need.

## Quick Check:
Visit these URLs and see if they have the updated content:
- https://paulmait.github.io/naturinex-legal/privacy-policy-enhanced.html
- https://paulmait.github.io/naturinex-legal/terms-of-service-enhanced.html

If they show:
- âœ… "CRITICAL MEDICAL DISCLAIMER"
- âœ… "AI Technology Notice"
- âœ… GDPR compliance sections
- âœ… Emergency warnings

Then they're already updated! If not, we need to update them.
