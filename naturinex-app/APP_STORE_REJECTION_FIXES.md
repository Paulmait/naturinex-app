# üö® Critical App Store Rejection Fixes

## High Risk Issues That WILL Cause Rejection

### 1. Medical Claims & Positioning (CRITICAL)
**Current Risk**: Your app suggests "natural alternatives" to medications
**Rejection Reason**: Apps cannot recommend stopping/replacing prescribed medications

**REQUIRED FIXES**:
```javascript
// Change all instances of:
"natural alternatives" ‚Üí "wellness information"
"replace medication" ‚Üí "complementary information"
"instead of" ‚Üí "alongside"
```

### 2. Update Your Stripe Webhook
Your webhook is pointing to the wrong URL!

**Current (Wrong)**: 
```
https://us-central1-mediscan-b6252.cloudfunctions.net/api/webhooks/stripe
```

**Should Be**:
```
https://naturinex-app-zsga.onrender.com/webhook
```

Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Edit endpoint ‚Üí Update URL

### 3. Required Screen Changes

#### A. Onboarding Screen
Add this as screen 1:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT MEDICAL NOTICE
This app provides educational wellness information only.
- NOT medical advice
- NOT a substitute for doctors
- NEVER stop prescribed medications
- Always consult healthcare providers
[‚úì] I understand and agree
```

#### B. Analysis Results Screen
Before showing any alternatives, display:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Medical Disclaimer
The information below is for educational purposes only.
Continue taking your prescribed medications.
Consult your doctor before trying any supplements.
[OK, I Understand]
```

### 4. App Store Metadata Changes

**App Name**: 
- From: "Naturinex - Medication Scanner"
- To: "Naturinex - Wellness Guide"

**Category**:
- From: Medical
- To: Education or Reference

**Description**: Remove these phrases:
- ‚ùå "natural alternatives to medications"
- ‚ùå "replace your prescriptions"
- ‚ùå "medication scanner"

Use instead:
- ‚úÖ "wellness education"
- ‚úÖ "supplement information"
- ‚úÖ "educational reference"

### 5. Code Changes Needed

1. **Update AnalysisScreen.js**:
```javascript
// Add before results display
const [disclaimerAccepted, setDisclaimerAccepted] = useState(false);

if (!disclaimerAccepted) {
  return (
    <DisclaimerModal 
      onAccept={() => setDisclaimerAccepted(true)}
      onDecline={() => navigation.goBack()}
    />
  );
}
```

2. **Update all API responses**:
```javascript
// Change
"alternatives" ‚Üí "wellness_information"
"effectiveness" ‚Üí "general_info"
"replace" ‚Üí "complement"
```

### 6. Privacy & Data Handling

Add to Privacy Policy:
- "We do not provide medical advice"
- "Consult healthcare providers"
- "Educational purposes only"
- Camera/photo usage explanation

### 7. Screenshots for App Store

DO NOT show:
- ‚ùå Prescription medications being "replaced"
- ‚ùå Medical claims or cures
