# üß™ Testing Strategy for Naturinex

## Phase 1: Expo Go Testing (1-2 days)
**Purpose:** Verify basic functionality and Firebase setup

### What to Test:
1. ‚úÖ User registration/login
2. ‚úÖ Basic UI navigation
3. ‚úÖ Medication name input
4. ‚úÖ API connectivity
5. ‚úÖ Firebase authentication
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited camera functionality

### Steps:
```bash
# 1. Update Firebase credentials in app.json
# 2. Start Expo
npm start

# 3. Test on your phone with Expo Go
# 4. Test these user flows:
#    - Sign up ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Enter medication ‚Üí Get results
#    - Logout ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Check persistent data
```

## Phase 2: Development Build Testing (2-3 days)
**Purpose:** Test features that don't work in Expo Go

### Build Development Version:
```bash
# Create development build
eas build --platform all --profile development

# This gives you a custom Expo Go with your native code
```

### Additional Features to Test:
1. ‚úÖ Stripe payment flow
2. ‚úÖ Full camera functionality
3. ‚úÖ Google OAuth (if configured)
4. ‚úÖ Image picker from gallery
5. ‚úÖ Proper permissions flow

## Phase 3: Preview Build Testing (2-3 days)
**Purpose:** Test production-like environment

### Build Preview Version:
```bash
# Create preview build (production-like but for testing)
eas build --platform all --profile preview

# Distribute to beta testers
eas build:submit --platform ios --to internal
```

### Beta Testing Checklist:
- [ ] 5-10 beta testers (friends/family)
- [ ] Different device types (old/new phones)
- [ ] Different OS versions
- [ ] Real payment testing (Stripe test mode)
- [ ] Edge cases (no internet, camera denied, etc.)

## Phase 4: Production Build (1 day)
**Purpose:** Final build for store submission

```bash
# Only after all testing passes
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

## Testing Checklist for Each Phase

### Essential Tests:
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - [ ] Sign up with email
   - [ ] Login/logout
   - [ ] Password reset
   - [ ] Stay logged in

2. **Core Functionality**
   - [ ] Enter medication name manually
   - [ ] Get AI suggestions
   - [ ] View results
   - [ ] Share results (email/copy)

3. **Premium Features**
   - [ ] View upgrade prompt
   - [ ] Complete payment (test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
   - [ ] Access premium features
   - [ ] Subscription management

4. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] No internet connection
   - [ ] Invalid medication names
   - [ ] Server errors
   - [ ] Payment failures

5. **Permissions**
   - [ ] Camera permission flow
   - [ ] Photo library permission
   - [ ] Handle permission denial

## Common Issues in Each Testing Phase

### Expo Go Issues:
- "Invariant Violation" ‚Üí Usually missing native dependencies
- "Network request failed" ‚Üí Check API URL and CORS
- Camera limitations ‚Üí Normal, need dev build

### Development Build Issues:
- Build failures ‚Üí Check native dependencies
- Crash on launch ‚Üí Usually signing/provisioning issues
- Payment not working ‚Üí Check Stripe configuration

### Preview Build Issues:
- Different behavior than dev ‚Üí Check environment variables
- Performance issues ‚Üí Enable production optimizations

## My Recommendation:

1. **Start with Expo Go TODAY** to verify:
   - Firebase is properly configured
   - Basic app flow works
   - API endpoints are accessible

2. **Move to Development Build** once basics work:
   - Test Stripe integration
   - Full camera functionality
   - Any native features

3. **Do Preview Build** for beta testing:
   - Get 5-10 real users
   - Test for 3-5 days
   - Fix any issues found

4. **Submit Production Build** only after:
   - All critical bugs fixed
   - Beta testers approve
   - You've tested payment flow completely

**Total Timeline: 7-10 days** from today to store submission

## Quick Start Commands:
```bash
# Right now - Test with Expo Go
npm start

# After Firebase setup - Build for development
eas build --platform all --profile development

# After dev testing - Build for preview
eas build --platform all --profile preview

# Final - Build for production
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

Remember: It's better to find bugs in testing than have users find them in production!
