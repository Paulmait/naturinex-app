1. **Update Stripe Prices**:
   - Create new price objects with recommended amounts
   - Keep old prices for existing subscribers

2. **A/B Test** (Optional):
   - Test current vs recommended pricing
   - Measure conversion rates

3. **Grandfather Existing Users**:
   - Keep current subscribers on old pricing
   - Builds loyalty and trust

## 📈 6-Month Review Metrics

Track these KPIs:
- Monthly vs Annual subscription ratio
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Churn rate by plan type
- Conversion rate from free trial/basic to premium

## 💰 Revenue Projection Example

Assuming 1,000 subscribers:
- **Current**: 70% monthly, 30% annual = ~$12,400/month
- **Recommended**: 50% monthly, 50% annual = ~$10,800/month
- **But**: Annual payments provide 6-12 months upfront cash flow
