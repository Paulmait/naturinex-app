# üéØ Free Trial Implementation Guide

## Overview
All subscription plans now include a free trial period before charging the user. This guide covers the complete implementation.

## ‚úÖ What's Implemented

### 1. Trial Periods
- **Regular Users**: 7-day free trial on all plans
- **Verified Students**: 14-day free trial (extended benefit)
- **Trial applies to**: Basic, Premium, and Professional tiers

### 2. Server-Side Implementation

#### Checkout Session Creation
```javascript
// Always includes trial period
sessionConfig.subscription_data.trial_period_days = finalTrialDays;

// Logic:
- Default: 7 days
- Students: 14 days
- Applied automatically to all subscriptions
```

#### Webhook Handlers
- `customer.subscription.created` - Tracks trial start
- `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` - Sends reminder (3 days before)
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Tracks trial conversion

### 3. Client-Side Features

#### Visual Indicators
- ‚ú® "7-day free trial" shown in all plan features
- Trial banner above subscribe button
- Dynamic button text: "Start 7-Day Free Trial"
- Student banner shows "14-day free trial"

#### User Context Awareness
```javascript
trialDays: userContext.isStudent ? 14 : 7
```

### 4. Database Schema

#### User Document
```javascript
{
  // Trial tracking
  isTrialing: boolean,
  trialStart: timestamp,
  trialEnd: timestamp,
  trialEndingSoon: boolean,
  trialConverted: boolean,
  trialConvertedAt: timestamp,
  
  // Subscription status
  subscriptionStatus: 'trialing' | 'active' | 'canceled',
  isPremium: boolean
}
```

#### Notifications Collection
```javascript
{
  userId: string,
  type: 'trial_ending',
  title: '‚è∞ Your free trial ends in 3 days!',
  message: string,
  subscriptionId: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  read: boolean
}
```

- **Insufficient funds**: 4000 0000 0000 9995

## üìä Analytics Tracking

### Key Metrics
1. **Trial Start Rate**: % of users who start trial
2. **Trial Conversion Rate**: % who convert to paid
3. **Trial Cancellation Rate**: % who cancel during trial
4. **Student vs Regular Conversion**: Compare rates

### Events Tracked

- `trial_ending_notification_sent` - 3-day warning
- `trial_converted` - Successfully charged
- `trial_canceled` - Canceled during trial

## üö® Important Considerations

### Payment Method Required
- Stripe requires card for trials
- Clear messaging: "No charge for 7 days"
- Card validation happens at checkout

### Trial Abuse Prevention
- One trial per user (tracked by Stripe customer)
- Cannot reuse trial after canceling
- Device/IP tracking for additional security

### Communication Timeline
- **Day 1**: Welcome email, trial started
- **Day 4**: Trial ending reminder
- **Day 6**: Last chance email
- **Day 7**: Charge notification or cancellation
