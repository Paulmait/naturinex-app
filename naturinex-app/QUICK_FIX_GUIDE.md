# üîß QUICK FIX GUIDE

## Issues Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ **AsyncStorage installed** for Firebase Auth persistence
2. ‚úÖ **Firebase configuration updated** to use AsyncStorage
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Width error** - May be a hot reload issue

## To Fix the Width Error:

### Option 1: Force Reload (Recommended)
1. **In the terminal** where Expo is running, press `r` to reload
2. **Or shake your device** and select "Reload"

### Option 2: Restart Expo
```cmd
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current process
# Then run:
cd C:\Users\maito\mediscan-app\naturinex-app
npx expo start --clear
```

### Option 3: Close and Reopen App
1. Close Expo Go app completely on your phone
2. Reopen Expo Go
3. Scan the QR code again

## The AsyncStorage Warning is FIXED!
Firebase Auth will now persist login sessions between app restarts.

## If Width Error Persists:
The error might be from a component trying to get screen dimensions before the app is ready. This usually resolves with a reload.

## Ready to Deploy?
Once the app loads without errors:
```cmd
deploy-now.bat
```
