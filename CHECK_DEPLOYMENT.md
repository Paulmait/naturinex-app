# üöÄ Deployment Status & Testing Guide

## Current Status: DEPLOYING
Your enhanced server is being deployed to Render. Expected time: 5-10 minutes.

## Step 1: Add Admin Secret to Render (NOW)

While deployment is in progress, add your admin secret:

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Select your service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add new variable:
   - **Key:** `ADMIN_SECRET`
   - **Value:** `nX9#mK2$pL7@wQ5!vR8*bT3^zY6&fH4`
5. Click **Save Changes**

## Step 2: Wait for Deployment (5-10 mins)

Check deployment status:
- Green check ‚úÖ = Deployed
- Yellow circle üü° = Deploying
- Red X ‚ùå = Failed (check logs)

## Step 3: Test Enhanced Features

### Test 1: Basic Health Check (No Auth Required)
```bash
curl https://naturinex-app-zsga.onrender.com/health
```

Expected: Detailed health metrics with cache and error stats

### Test 2: Admin Metrics (Requires Auth)
```bash
curl https://naturinex-app-zsga.onrender.com/admin/metrics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer nX9#mK2$pL7@wQ5!vR8*bT3^zY6&fH4"
```

Expected: Comprehensive admin dashboard data

### Test 3: Test Caching (Should be faster on 2nd request)
```bash
# First request (will be cached)
curl -X POST https://naturinex-app-zsga.onrender.com/suggest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"medicationName":"tylenol"}'

# Second request (should return instantly from cache)
curl -X POST https://naturinex-app-zsga.onrender.com/suggest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"medicationName":"tylenol"}'
```

### Test 4: Clear Cache (Admin Only)
```bash
curl -X POST https://naturinex-app-zsga.onrender.com/admin/cache/clear \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer nX9#mK2$pL7@wQ5!vR8*bT3^zY6&fH4" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pattern":"suggest"}'
```

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

Your enhanced server is working if:
1. `/health` returns version "3.0.0-enhanced"
2. `/admin/metrics` returns data (with auth)
3. Second identical requests are faster (caching works)
4. Error tracking shows in metrics

## üö® Troubleshooting

If admin endpoint returns "Unauthorized":
- Ensure ADMIN_SECRET is set in Render environment
- Check you're using correct Bearer token
- Wait for Render to fully restart after adding env var

If deployment fails:
- Check Render logs for errors
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- Verify GitHub push was successful

## üìä What You Can Now Monitor

With `/admin/metrics` you can track:
- **Server Health**: Uptime, memory, CPU usage
- **Performance**: Request counts, response times
- **Errors**: Error rates, types, and patterns
- **Cache**: Hit rates, size, efficiency
- **Critical Alerts**: Auto-restart recommendations
