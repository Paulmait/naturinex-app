## 🔧 How to Deploy Enhanced Server

### Option 1: Quick Switch (Recommended)
```bash
# Backup current server
cp server/index.js server/index-original.js

# Replace with enhanced version
cp server/index-enhanced.js server/index.js

# Install missing dependency
cd server
npm install compression

# Deploy to Render
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy enhanced production server"
git push origin master
```

### Option 2: Gradual Migration
Test enhancements individually before full deployment:
1. Deploy health monitoring first
2. Add error tracking after verification
3. Implement caching last

## 🔐 Security Enhancements
