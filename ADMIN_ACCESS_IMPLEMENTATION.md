# ðŸ”§ Admin Access Implementation

## âœ… **ADMIN ACCESS CONFIGURED**

### **Admin Email Added:**
Your email `guampaul@gmail.com` has been added as an admin user in:

1. **Dashboard.js** - Client-side admin check
2. **firestore.rules** - Database security rules
3. **Firebase rules deployed** - Security rules active

### **Admin Functionality:**
Once logged in with your Gmail account (`guampaul@gmail.com`), you will have:

- âœ… Access to Analytics Dashboard
- âœ… User statistics and insights  
- âœ… Device tracking information
- âœ… Scan event analytics
- âœ… Admin-only Firebase collections

### **How to Access Admin Panel:**
1. **Login with your Gmail account** (`guampaul@gmail.com`)
2. **Go to Profile tab** in the bottom navigation
3. **Look for "Admin Controls" section** (will appear for admin users only)
4. **Click "View Analytics Dashboard"** to access admin features

### **Security:**
- Admin access is restricted to specific email addresses only
- Firebase security rules enforce admin permissions at database level
- Client-side checks provide UI restrictions

### **Testing Admin Access:**
1. Clear browser cache and refresh app
2. Login with `guampaul@gmail.com`
3. Check Profile tab for admin controls
