# Naturinex User Experience & Monetization Strategy

## üéØ Onboarding Strategy (Inspired by Cal AI)

### Psychological Principles Applied

#### 1. **Show Benefits Early** (Step 1-2)
- **Welcome Screen**: Immediately shows value proposition with clear benefits
- **Trust Building**: Privacy and security emphasized upfront (medical context crucial)
- **Social Proof**: "Join thousands who've improved their wellness journey"

#### 2. **Reduce Friction on Personal Questions** (Step 3-4)
- **Age Ranges**: Instead of exact age (less intrusive)
- **Multiple Choice**: Easy selection vs. free-form text
- **Optional Fields**: Skip options available for sensitive topics
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Most personal questions come after trust is established

#### 3. **Dashboard Preview** (Step 5)
- **Tangible Value**: Shows exactly what they'll get with their data
- **Personalization**: Uses their actual inputs in the preview
- **Visual Demonstration**: Mock interface builds excitement

#### 4. **Strategic Paywall Placement** (Step 6)
- **After Value Demo**: Only after they've seen what's possible
- **Clear ROI**: Shows how premium features enhance their experience
- **Gentle Pressure**: Free option still available, no hard sell

### Trust Building Elements (Medical Context)

## üí∞ Monetization Strategy

### Freemium Model Structure

### Conversion Optimization

#### 1. **Value Ladder**

  Sign up ‚Üí Daily usage ‚Üí Hit limits ‚Üí Upgrade
```
