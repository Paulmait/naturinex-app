# iPhone Testing Guide for Naturinex

## ‚úÖ Setup Complete!

You're now ready to test Naturinex on your iPhone. Here are your testing options:

## Option 1: Quick Testing with Expo Go (Recommended for Initial Testing)

1. **Install Expo Go on your iPhone**
   - Download from App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779

2. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

3. **Connect your iPhone**
   - Make sure your iPhone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network
   - Open Expo Go app on your iPhone
   - Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal with your iPhone camera
   - The app will load in Expo Go

## Option 2: Development Build (Full Features)

For testing all features including camera, Stripe payments, and native functionality:

1. **Create a development build**
   ```bash
   cd client
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   ```

2. **Wait for build** (usually 15-30 minutes)
   - You'll receive an email when the build is complete
   - Or check status at: https://expo.dev/accounts/guampaul/projects

3. **Install on iPhone**
   - Click the link in the email to install via TestFlight
   - Or download the .ipa file and install using Apple Configurator

## Troubleshooting

1. **"Metro bundler not found"**

   - Try using tunnel mode: `npm start -- --tunnel`

4. **Build errors**
