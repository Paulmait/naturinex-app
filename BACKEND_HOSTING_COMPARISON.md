# Backend Hosting Options Comparison for Node.js

## Can I use Hostinger?

**Yes, but with limitations.** Hostinger offers different plans:

### Hostinger Shared Hosting (Web Hosting)
- ❌ **Cannot run Node.js** applications
- Only for static websites (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP)
- Similar to GoDaddy Website Builder

### Hostinger VPS (Virtual Private Server)
- ✅ **Can run Node.js** applications
- Requires technical knowledge (Linux, server management)
- Starting at ~$5.99/month
- You need to install Node.js, configure nginx, manage SSL, etc.

### Hostinger Cloud Hosting
- ✅ **Can run Node.js** with configuration
- More expensive (~$9.99+/month)
- Still requires some technical setup

## Why I Recommended Render

### 1. **Zero Configuration**

- 750 hours/month (enough for 1 app running 24/7)

- Great for Node.js/Express
- Easy environment variables
