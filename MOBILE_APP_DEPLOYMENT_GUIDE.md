# üöÄ Naturinex Mobile App Store Deployment Guide
**Beta Version 1.0.0 - Apple App Store & Google Play Store**

## üì± Mobile App Packaging Strategy

We'll use **Ionic Capacitor** to package your React web app into native iOS and Android applications. This approach allows us to:
- Keep your existing React codebase unchanged
- Add native mobile features (camera, storage, etc.)
- Deploy to both app stores with a single codebase
- Maintain web app functionality with native performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Process

### Step 1: Install Capacitor
```bash
cd client
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npm install @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android
npx cap init naturinex com.naturinex.app
```

### Step 2: Build Production React App
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Add Native Platforms
```bash
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

### Step 4: Configure App Settings
Update capacitor.config.ts with proper app information

### Step 5: Sync Web Assets
```bash
npx cap sync
```
